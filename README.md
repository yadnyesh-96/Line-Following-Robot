# 🤖 Line Following Robot

## 📌 Abstract
The **Line Following Robot** is an autonomous mobile robot built using **Arduino Mega, IR sensors, and L293D motor driver IC**.  
It is designed to follow a black line path on a white surface using **PID control logic**, demonstrating real-world applications of **control systems, robotics, and embedded systems**.  

This project was developed as part of my **academic coursework**, where I contributed to both **hardware design** and **software programming**.
